    This file lists the userGroupProviders, accessPolicyProviders, and authorizers to use when running securely. In order
    to use a specific authorizer it must be configured here and its identifier must be specified in the nifi-registry.properties file.
    If the authorizer is a managedAuthorizer, it may need to be configured with an accessPolicyProvider and an userGroupProvider.
    This file allows for configuration of them, but they must be configured in order:

        The LdapUserGroupProvider will retrieve users and groups from an LDAP server. The users and groups
        are not configurable.

        'Authentication Strategy' - How the connection to the LDAP server is authenticated. Possible
            values are ANONYMOUS, SIMPLE, LDAPS, or START_TLS.

        'Manager DN' - The DN of the manager that is used to bind to the LDAP server to search for users.
        'Manager Password' - The password of the manager that is used to bind to the LDAP server to
            search for users.

        'TLS - Keystore' - Path to the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Password' - Password for the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP
            using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Type' - Type of the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Truststore' - Path to the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Password' - Password for the Truststore that is used when connecting to
            LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Type' - Type of the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Client Auth' - Client authentication policy when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
            Possible values are REQUIRED, WANT, NONE.
        'TLS - Protocol' - Protocol to use when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS. (i.e. TLS,
            TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, etc).
        'TLS - Shutdown Gracefully' - Specifies whether the TLS should be shut down gracefully
            before the target context is closed. Defaults to false.

        'Referral Strategy' - Strategy for handling referrals. Possible values are FOLLOW, IGNORE, THROW.
        'Connect Timeout' - Duration of connect timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).
        'Read Timeout' - Duration of read timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).

        'Url' - Space-separated list of URLs of the LDAP servers (i.e. ldap://<hostname>:<port>).
        'Page Size' - Sets the page size when retrieving users and groups. If not specified, no paging is performed.
        'Sync Interval' - Duration of time between syncing users and groups. (i.e. 30 mins).

        'User Search Base' - Base DN for searching for users (i.e. ou=users,o=nifi). Required to search users.
        'User Object Class' - Object class for identifying users (i.e. person). Required if searching users.
        'User Search Scope' - Search scope for searching users (ONE_LEVEL, OBJECT, or SUBTREE). Required if searching users.

        'Group Object Class' - Object class for identifying groups (i.e. groupOfNames). Required if searching groups.
        'Group Search Scope' - Search scope for searching groups (ONE_LEVEL, OBJECT, or SUBTREE). Required if searching groups.
        'Group Search Filter' - Filter for searching for groups against the 'Group Search Base'. Optional.
        'Group Name Attribute' - Attribute to use to extract group name (i.e. cn). Optional. If not set, the entire DN is used.
        'Group Member Attribute' - Attribute to use to define group membership (i.e. member). Optional. If not set
            group membership will not be calculated through the groups. Will rely on group member being defined
            through 'User Group Name Attribute' if set.

        NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi-registry.properties will also be applied to the user identities.
            Group names are not mapped.

        The FileAccessPolicyProvider will provide support for managing access policies which is backed by a file
        on the local file system.

        - User Group Provider - The identifier for an User Group Provider defined above that will be used to access
            users and groups for use in the managed access policies.

        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAccessPolicyProvider will store policies.

        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and
            given the ability to create additional users, groups, and policies. The value of this property could be
            a DN when using certificates or LDAP. This property will only be used when there
            are no other policies defined.

            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi-registry.properties will also be applied to the initial admin identity,
            so the value should be the unmapped identity. This identity must be found in the configured User Group Provider.

        - NiFi Identity [unique key] - The identity of a NiFi node that will have access to this NiFi Registry and will be able
            to act as a proxy on behalf of a NiFi Registry end user. A property should be created for the identity of every NiFi
            node that needs to access this NiFi Registry.
