# Integration Test Keys

The integration tests that run a secure NiFi require keystores and truststores for the server and client in order
to establish a two-way TLS connection.

The keys/certs for these tests were generated with the tls-toolkit included with NiFi Toolkit v1.4.0.

The steps for generating replacements are:

    # use NiFi tls-toolkit to generate CA, server key/cert, client key/cert
    ./nifi-toolkit-1.4.0/bin/tls-toolkit.sh standalone --certificateAuthorityHostname localhost --hostnames localhost --nifiDnSuffix ", OU=nifi" --keyStorePassword localhostKeystorePassword --trustStorePassword localhostTruststorePassword --clientCertDn "CN=user1, OU=nifi" --clientCertPassword u1Pass --days 3650 --outputDirectory nifireg-integrationtest

    # change to tls-toolkit output directory
    cd ./nifireg-integrationtest

    # copy server's key/trust stores
    mkdir keys
    cp localhost/keystore.jks keys/localhost-ks.jks
    cp localhost/truststore.jks keys/localhost-ts.jks

    # create a Java Key Store (JKS) from the client key
    keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore keys/client-ks.jks -deststorepass clientKeystorePassword -destkeypass u1Pass -srckeystore CN=user1_OU=nifi.p12 -srcstorepass u1Pass -srcstoretype PKCS12


You should now have a directory with the following contents:
    keys/
     +-- client-ks.jks      # client keystore: keystorePass=clientKeystorePassword, keyPass=u1Pass
     +-- localhost-ks.jks   # server keystore: keystorePass=localhostKeystorePassword, keyPass=localhostKeystorePassword
     +-- localhost-ts.jks   # server/client truststore (contains CA): truststorePass=localhostTruststorePassword

Copy these files to the test/resources/keys/ directory.
